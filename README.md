# Square, Inc. in Depth
## Domain: Payment Processing & Financial Services

Square began its journey as a disruptor in the payment processing space. Founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (also the co-founder of Twitter) and Jim McKelvey, the company introduced a small, square-shaped card reader that could be attached to smartphones, enabling merchants, especially small businesses, to accept card payments without traditional, costly point-of-sale systems.

Over the years, Square has diversified its offerings and now provides a broader range of financial services. This expansion includes services like business loans through Square Capital, facilitating payroll, and even venturing into banking with Square Financial Services, a direct subsidiary.

## Audience: Small to Medium Businesses & General Public

Square's initial target audience was small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that found traditional payment processing systems to be cumbersome and expensive. By providing an affordable, efficient, and user-friendly solution, Square democratized payment processing for SMBs.

Furthermore, with the introduction of Cash App, Square expanded its reach to the general public, providing an easy-to-use platform for personal money transfers, investing in stocks, and even buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

## Solution: Payment Solutions, Business Financing, Cash App

Payment Solutions: Square's core product remains its payment processing solutions. This includes the iconic card reader, point-of-sale systems, and e-commerce integrations. The company has continuously innovated its hardware and software offerings to cater to the evolving needs of businesses.
Business Financing: Square Capital offers loans to businesses based on their transaction history with Square. This model provides SMBs with a quick and straightforward financing solution, bypassing the traditional, often lengthy, loan application processes.
Cash App: Originally launched as Square Cash, Cash App has grown exponentially in popularity. It allows users to send and receive money, invest in stocks, and buy Bitcoin. The app has been pivotal in introducing many younger users to the world of investing and cryptocurrencies.
Business Metrics: Multi-billion dollar valuation, Millions of active users

Square's innovative approach to financial services has earned it a multi-billion dollar valuation. Its IPO in 2015 solidified its position as a fintech powerhouse. Over the years, the company's stock has seen significant appreciation, reflecting its growth and the market's confidence in its business model.

In terms of user base, Cash App alone had surpassed 30 million monthly transacting active users by late 2020. The company's broader ecosystem, including its payment solutions for businesses, touches millions more, making it a dominant player in the fintech landscape.

### Fintech Domain Trends

**1. Mobile Payment Revolution:**

One of the most significant trends Square tapped into early on was the shift towards mobile payments. Recognizing that many small business owners found traditional payment processing systems expensive and cumbersome, Square's introduction of a mobile card reader transformed the landscape. The tiny device, which could be plugged into a smartphone or tablet, allowed merchants to process card payments anywhere, anytime.

**2. Democratization of Financial Services:**

Square has been at the forefront of democratizing access to financial services, especially for small businesses. From payment processing to loans, Square's services have been designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind. This trend toward democratization has been seen industry-wide, with fintechs striving to break down barriers that traditionally kept many individuals and businesses from accessing critical financial services.

**3. Integration of AI and Machine Learning:**

While Square started with straightforward payment solutions, its foray into data analytics, AI, and machine learning has been notable. By analyzing transaction data, Square can offer personalized business insights to merchants and even predict lending risks for its Square Capital loans.

**4. Diversification into Personal Finance:**

The launch of Cash App marked Square's move into personal finance, tapping into the trend of peer-to-peer payments. But Cash App's offerings didn't stop thereâ€”it now includes stock investments and cryptocurrency trading, marking significant milestones in Square's journey.

**5. Branching into Banking:**

A landmark move for Square was obtaining a banking license and establishing Square Financial Services in 2020. This move allows Square to offer FDIC-insured bank accounts and loans directly, rather than partnering with existing banks.

**6. Rise of Contactless Payments:**

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards contactless payments, a trend Square was well-positioned for. With its contactless payment solutions, Square catered to both merchants and customers looking for safer payment methods during such times.

**7. Global Expansion:**

Initially starting in the U.S., Square recognized the global potential for its services. Its expansion into markets like Japan, Canada, Australia, and the UK marks the company's commitment to capturing the global fintech market.

**8. E-commerce and Virtual Storefronts:**

With the rise of online shopping, Square ventured into e-commerce, allowing businesses to set up virtual storefronts. This move tapped into the larger trend of brick-and-mortar stores seeking online presence, further accelerated by global events like the pandemic.

In essence, Square, Inc.'s journey in the fintech sector reflects a keen understanding of market trends and a proactive approach to innovation.
